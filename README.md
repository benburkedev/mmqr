# mmqr
Multi Message QR encoder and decoder.

QR codes can be wonderful things, as long as we don't expect too much of them.

Load them up with more than a few hundred bytes and the scanning ecosystem starts to fall to bits pretty quickly.

This simple bash script demonstrates a model (might be a protocol one day ) to allow larger amounts of data 
to be encoded into multiple QR Codes, without the need to alter standards, lower error correction and so fort.

Lots to be learned about possibilities here, including https://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201905959973509.page
